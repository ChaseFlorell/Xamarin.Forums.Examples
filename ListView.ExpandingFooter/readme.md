##[A ListView with an expanding footer](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/48405/a-listview-with-an-expanding-footer)##

Hey guys,

I've been Googling around for a while and I'm unable to find something that will help me do what I need. 

I want a ListView where the footer will expand to fill the screen if there are not enough items to fill the list (And stay in the scroll with a minimum height when its full.

What I'm trying to accomplish:

Once the minimum height is hit, it should scroll.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance
